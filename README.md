Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my projects page, This is one that I did for my ITSC 1213 course at UNC Charlotte. 
I was tasked with designing and implementing my own project that would show off some of the important skills that I had learned through the course.
These skills included Inheritance, Abstraction, File Interfaces, Overloading, and Exception Handling.
This project was a lot of fun, and allowed for a cool introduction to object oriented programming in Java.
